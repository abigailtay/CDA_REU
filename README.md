**JEPA Image Segmentation for Cattle Images**

This repository contains resources and code for applying Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) to the task of image segmentation with cattle images. The goal is to segment individual cattle from images using modern self-supervised learning techniques and computer vision.

## Project Overview

- Leverages JEPA, a self-supervised deep learning architecture, to learn useful cattle representations from unlabelled images.
- Focuses on segmenting cattle silhouettes and parsing image regions for downstream animal health and behavior research.
- Applies computer vision pipelines for dataset loading, image pre-processing, and mask generation on annotated cattle datasets.

## How It Works

1. **Dataset Preparation:**
   - Images of cattle (JPEG/PNG) are loaded and optionally augmented for robust training.
   - Ground truth segmentation masks specify the cattle regions in each image.
2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Utilizes JEPA for feature learning.
   - Segmentation head predicts pixel-level masks, locating cattle in new images.
3. **Training & Evaluation:**
   - Model is trained with typical image segmentation objectives (Dice, IoU, Cross-Entropy).
   - Includes scripts for model validation and metrics visualization.

## Features

- JEPA-based learning for cattle segmentation
- Code & scripts for training, evaluation, and prediction
- Utilities for data loading, augmentation, and mask visualization
- Sample annotated data and trained model checkpoints (if available)

## Technologies Used

- Python, PyTorch
- JEPA model architecture
- Computer vision libraries: OpenCV, torchvision

## Future Work

- Expand dataset with more farm environments and breeds
- Integrate instance segmentation and fine-grained mask output
- Link segmentation to behavioral/health analysis (e.g., movement tracking)
